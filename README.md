This project is to understand the motivations behind arrival times to work based on a survey of employees conducted in Rennes, France. The data is then used to model the decision-making process of employees regarding their ability to shift their regular arrival times in order to reduce congestion at peak hours. The code looks at ensemble modelling techniques such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, as well as the Neural Network Framework. 
Based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1 score, the best model is chosen. Learning Curves are also shown.

To run:
Simply run the python file model_benchmarking.py. It automatically calls the related functions to preprocess data and the attention layer of neural network model.
